  "Experiences and Preferences for Self-Guided Digital Intervention Apps for
  Eating Disorders"
---

Self-guided digital interventions for the treatment of eating disorders (<a
class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a>) are becoming increasingly popular. However, the
effectiveness of these interventions is still under investigation. The
meta-analysis "User Experiences of and Preferences for Self-Guided Digital
Interventions for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Eating Disorders" by <a
href="https://doi.org/10.2196/57795">Cheung et al. (2025)</a>  aims to provide
insights into the user experiences and preferences for these interventions.

<div class="highlight-box" markdown="1">

## Meta-Analysis Overview

**Focus of study**: User Experiences of and Preferences for Self-Guided Digital
Interventions for the Treatment of Mild to Moderate Eating Disorders.

**Target Group**: Adults (18-67 years) with mild-moderate
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms, predominantly female and Caucasian,
mostly self-reporting symptoms.

**Key Findings**: Most users reported positive experiences with digital
interventions, finding them convenient, flexible, and helpful for increasing
self-reflection and mindfulness. Digital interventions were effective in
reducing <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> thoughts and behaviors. However,
users generally perceived them as insufficient as standalone treatments, viewing
them either as an early intervention before traditional therapy or as a "last
resort" after unsuccessful treatment attempts.

**Additional Findings**: Users strongly emphasized the need for personalization
and customization of digital interventions to accommodate diverse
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms, triggers, and knowledge levels, with
preferences for varied content formats, support options (both professional and
peer), and intuitive interfaces that minimize technical difficulties.

## Introduction

Eating disorders represent a significant global health challenge, with lifetime
prevalence rates of 8.4% for women and 2.2% for men. Healthcare systems
worldwide struggle to meet treatment demands, particularly following the
COVID-19 pandemic which saw increased <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms
and referrals. Long waitlists have forced specialist services to prioritize
severe cases, leaving individuals with mild to moderate
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a>s with limited options.

Digital interventions delivered through smartphone applications or websites
offer a promising solution. These interventions typically provide cognitive
behavioral therapy (<a class="gls" href="#cbt">CBT</a>)-based approaches
including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and self-monitoring
components. They address both structural barriers (providing immediate, low-cost
access) and non-structural barriers such as stigma by offering discrete
treatment approaches.

Despite demonstrated effectiveness in reducing <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a>
behaviors and attitudes with medium effect sizes, digital interventions face
significant challenges with engagement. Dropout rates range from 5.3% to 76.8%
(averaging 26.3%), considerably higher than for face-to-face treatments,
suggesting issues with adherence that may limit their effectiveness.

The meta-analysis by Cheung et al. (2025) addresses these concerns by
systematically reviewing qualitative studies on user experiences and
preferences. The findings identified seven key metathemes including the appeal
of digital interventions, their perceived role in treatment, and design
preferences. While users generally reported positive experiences, they
emphasized the need for personalization to address diverse symptoms and
individual needs.

## What is the study about?

This meta-analysis investigates user experiences and preferences for self-guided
digital interventions designed to treat mild to moderate eating disorders in
adults. The researchers conducted a comprehensive review of qualitative studies
published between 2013 and 2024, ultimately including 8 studies after screening
3,695 search results. The included studies focused on primarily unguided digital
self-help interventions in naturalistic or outpatient settings. Studies were
excluded if they targeted prevention rather than treatment, involved
participants under 18 years old, focused on specific subgroups with comorbid
conditions, or featured fully guided interventions.

The meta-synthesis addressed two primary research questions: (1) What are user
experiences of digital interventions for reducing
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms in adults? and (2) What are user
preferences for digital interventions for reducing
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms in adults? To answer these questions,
the researchers conducted a thematic synthesis using line-by-line coding of
results from each study, generating themes that captured key aspects of user
experiences and preferences. This approach allowed for an in-depth exploration
of attitudes, views, and experiences critical to intervention acceptability,
outcome, and engagement.

## What does the study tell us?

This meta-analysis reveals that **self-guided digital interventions for eating
disorders offer significant benefits** through their accessibility, anonymity,
and flexibility. Users consistently reported that these interventions **enhanced
self-awareness and reflection**, promoting mindfulness during challenging
moments and reducing eating disorder thoughts and behaviors. The _convenience
and discrete nature_ of digital tools created a safe environment for users to
engage with treatment without fear of stigma or judgment.

However, the study uncovers an important limitation: users generally **did not
perceive digital interventions as sufficient standalone treatments**. Most
participants viewed these tools either as a _stepping stone to traditional
therapy_ or as a _"last resort"_ after unsuccessful treatment attempts. The
effectiveness of digital interventions was **significantly influenced by
personalization options**, with users emphasizing the need for customizable
content and functions to address their unique symptoms, triggers, and knowledge
levels.

The findings highlight that **support remains crucial** in digital
interventions, whether from professionals (providing accountability and
guidance) or peers (reducing isolation and offering understanding). Users
strongly preferred varied content formats (audio, visual, text) over text-heavy
presentations and expressed divergent preferences regarding interface design and
features like food logging. Perhaps most importantly, the meta-analysis
demonstrates that **user engagement is directly linked to perceived relevance**
of the intervention to individual needs, suggesting that _future development
should prioritize adaptive, person-centered approaches_ that can evolve with
users throughout their recovery journey.

## How do we assess this study?

This evaluation was done according to the <a class="gls" href="#magic">MAGIC
Criteria</a>, using the following five questions:

### How substantial are the effects?

The study is a qualitative meta-synthesis, and as such, it does not report
statistical values of individual studies. Nevertheless, it does suggest that the
effects of self-guided digital interventions for
<a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a> are **modest, but subjectively meaningful**.
A great majority described short-term improvement in self-reflection and
disordered pattern awareness, but they also reported their perception of these
types of interventions as being insufficient to replace traditional therapy.
Additionally, different methods and intervention formats (web-based,
smartphone-based, hypothetical intervention etc.) were used in the original
studies, further limiting the comparability of the effects.

Summa summarum, it can be said that the effects of the study are situational and
heavily dependant on many individual factors.

### How are the results presented?

Through systematic analysis, seven metathemes emerged that comprehensively
describe how users perceive and engage with digital
<a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> interventions:

These themes provide valuable insights into why users engage with or disengage
from digital interventions, highlighting the importance of personalization and
user-centered design to improve adherence and effectiveness.

### How generalizable are the findings?

The first obstacle to results' potential to be generalizable is the
heterogeneity of the primary studies that all differ in subject pools and
methodologies, resulting in a very dispersed effect. One of the limitations that
the authors themselves acknowledge is the lack of diversity in the original
studies, with most participants being college educated females from western
countries with very few outliers, all of which are in a smaller or greater
degree aware of their disordered patterns and are actively seeking help, which
already suggests a selection bias. Another caveat is that eating disorders are
highly individual, so striking the balance between all different needs and
functionalities is very hard. The authors provide a set of design guidelines
extracted from the users' experiences and comments, but not a systematic,
transferable design framework to follow. As such, the insights are informative,
but lack precision, and can be described as moderately generalizable.

### What makes the meta analysis scientifically relevant?

First and foremost, this is a **timely** synthesis of user experiences with
self-guided digital interventions for <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a>. The
focus is on the prioritization of user agency, accessibility and lived
experience in (digital) treatment design. The study identifies key areas
important to most users with mild and moderate eating disorders. The findings
have practical implications for the design of future digital interventions,
enabling the designers to better address diverse needs and preferences of users
with <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a>, and the researchers to choose a
direction for further studies. Despite the needs being accurately recognized,
the study does not suggest any (novel) conceptual frameworks for practical
implementation. The paper's strengths thus lie more in the descriptive summary,
than they do in innovation.

### How methodologically reliable are the findings?

The study uses a methodologically solid approach: systematic selection criteria,
quality appraisal using CAPS conducted by two independent researchers,
structured thematic analysis, precise questions distinguishing between user
preferences and experiences, transparency with their choices and reflexivity
within the interpretation. However, it is important to note that the variability
and quality of the primary studies both influence the reliability of the
otherwise structurally sound methodology. Out of 8 included studies, 5 used
notably distinct study methods, 2 of which did not require the use of a digital
intervention and 3 included some form of guidance within the intervention. The
studies that met the criteria and were chosen also lack ethnic and demographic
diversity, thus impacting the potential to generalize the findings and apply
them in different cultural contexts.

## Practical Implications

Even with acknowledging the previously mentioned limitations, the study offers
actionable recommendations for the design and deployment of future (unguided)
digital interventions in the <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> realm:

- **Personalization:** As eating disorders are highly individual, the
  interventions should be tailored to each user's particular needs.
- **Customization:** Tying in with personalization, the interventions should
  allow users to customize their experience. This could include the ability to
  select which features they want to use, how they want to track their progress,
  and what types of content and media they want to engage with.

These two points lead to one recommendation: the users should be able to
"co-design" the intervention upon setup. That includes allowing the users to
select the features they want to use, how they want to track their progress,
what kind of media they prefer, and what their choices are on the overall
design, look and feel of the intervention.

- **Support:** A level of support is a factor still needed when it comes to
  healing from an <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a>. Even though most of the
  review interventions were designed with no guidance in mind, the users still
  expressed their wishes for a certain level of interpersonal support,
  preferring a hybrid approach over complete autonomy. The fine level between
  autonomy and guidance is still to be determined, as it is highly individual.
  To that end, the authors suggest that user-dependent, AI powered support be
  tested in future works.

## Illustrative Study Examples

Two studies from the meta-analysis are highlighted to illustrate the findings.
The first study focuses on user experiences and preferences, while the second
study evaluates the usability of a specific digital intervention.

### Study Example 1: User Experiences and Preferences

Based on the results of the CASP review conducted by two individual authors, the
highest scoring study was the one conducted by
<a href="https://formative.jmir.org/2022/10/e38387/">Jafari et al, in 2021.</a>
The study had scored 23 out of 30 points, with deductions being in the domains
of appropriate recruitment (1/3), appropriate data collection (2/3), considered reflexivity (2/3), considered ethical issues (1/3), clear findings (2/3) and value of research (2/3).

In their <a href="https://mental.jmir.org/2025/1/e57795/#ref60">Multimedia
Appendix 3</a>, the authors state the main findings in two distinct areas to be:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 50%">User experiences</th>
      <th style="width: 50%">User preferences</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Enthusiastic and open to trying a new approach. The app improved user’s wellbeing by promoting self-care activities. Users found the app’s convenience dependent on the context and environment.
      </td>
      <td>
        More interactive features to sustain engagement, a calorie counting function, and more social interaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        Students rarely pay for apps and often overlook apps that cost money.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The study by Jafari et al. involves an app specifically designed to help deal
with binge eating using the tactics of mindful eating. The study assesses early
stage facets using a mixed methods approach among undergraduate women who binge
eat and clinical experts in the field of disordered eating and nutrition.

Results show that the users experienced decreases in binge eating, increases in
intuitive eating, and to a small degree, increases in mindful eating. The
intervention demonstrated good feasibility with a 92% retention rate.
Participants used the app for an average of 23.8 ± 5.7 days over the course of 4
weeks, 2-3 times per day, for 2-4 minutes each time. 83% of participants
indicated daily app usage.

Overall, the study shows the effectiveness of the app in curbing binge eating,
as well as providing both a collection of the most wanted features according to
the participants (interactivity and diversified forms of interaction with the
app, food logging fields, lower costs as the app was priced at 2.99$), as well
as expert opinions, with the clinicians being generally enthusiastic and ready
to use the app as a foundational tool for assisting clients with learning basic
awareness and interceptive skills.

### Study Example 2: Usability Evaluation

Another noteworthy study included in the meta-analysis was conducted by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01454455211021764">Linardon et al. (2022)</a>
, who evaluated the usability of a cognitive-behavioral app-based intervention
for binge eating called "Break Binge Eating." Fourteen participants (11 female)
with self-reported binge eating episodes were recruited to test the app for
seven days before participating in a test session.

The test session incorporated multiple assessment methods including the _Eating
Disorder Examination Questionnaire_ to evaluate ED symptom severity, alongside
comprehensive usability measurements. Researchers employed the validated System
Usability Scale (SUS) and additional usability scales for quantitative
assessment, complemented by qualitative data collection through think-aloud
tasks and semi-structured interviews. This multi-method approach enabled a
thorough evaluation of the app's functional utility and user experience from
different analytical perspectives.

The qualtative data was analyzed using thematic analysis, with the themes
usability, visual design, user engagement, content, therapeutic persuasiveness,
and therapeutic alliance emerging as key areas of focus.

Key advantages reported by users included:

- Flexible content-delivery formats (audio, text, and images)
- High level of interactivity through e.g. quizzes and progress tracking
- Ability to track progress, which increased self-awareness and motivation

However, participants also expressed concerns about:

- Visual aesthetics (some found the design too simplistic)
- Lack of professional feedback and support

Overall, the study highlighted the importance of usability and user experience
in digital interventions for binge eating, emphasizing the need for a balance
between engaging content and professional support. The findings underscore the
potential of digital interventions to enhance self-awareness and motivation.
