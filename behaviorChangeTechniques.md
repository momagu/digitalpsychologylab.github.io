  "Behavior Change Techniques in Digital Interventions for Eating Disorders:
  Findings from a Meta-Analysis"
---

Digital interventions offer significant promise in addressing the treatment gap
for eating disorders, with specific behavior change techniques showing
consistent effectiveness across multiple studies. Understanding which techniques
work best is crucial for developing evidence-based digital solutions that can
reach those currently unable to access traditional care.

<div class="highlight-box" markdown="1">

## Meta-Analysis Overview

**Focus of study**: Identification and analysis of behavior change techniques
(<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a>) in digital interventions for eating
disorders, examining which techniques are most frequently associated with
effective interventions

**Target Group**: Adults with mild to moderate eating disorders, primarily
females (>90% in most studies) aged 17-55 years

**Effect Sizes**: Moderate and statistically significant improvement in eating
disorder symptoms for digital interventions compared to waitlist or
treatment-as-usual controls (MD=-0.57, 95% CI −0.080 to −0.39; p<0.001)

**Additional Findings**: Interventions with stronger theoretical grounding
showed significantly better outcomes; the most common effective
<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> (defined as those present in at least 75%
of effective interventions) included self-monitoring of behavior,
problem-solving, information about antecedents, feedback on behavior, and
self-monitoring of outcomes

## Introduction

Eating disorders (<a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a>) have the highest death
rate among psychiatric disorders and can cause lasting physical, emotional, and
neurobiological damage when untreated. The current treatment model fails to meet
patient needs, with most individuals with <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a> not
receiving proper care due to limited access to specialized services, long
waiting times, and the shame associated with these conditions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made these challenges worse, causing more urgent
referrals and longer waiting times in an already under-resourced system. There
is an urgent need to develop alternative treatment approaches that can support
traditional care pathways and address this critical service gap.

Digital interventions—including websites, mobile applications, and other
technology-based platforms—can improve access to evidence-based treatments.
These interventions have several advantages: they can reach many individuals at
minimal cost, can be accessed anonymously when convenient for the user, and
allow for self-paced engagement. The anonymity of digital interventions may be
especially helpful for individuals with <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a> who
often face shame as a barrier to seeking traditional treatment.

Digital self-management interventions can expand the reach of evidence-based
treatments and help more individuals receive support for their condition.
Research shows promising evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions
in treating <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms, with results often
maintained or improved at follow-up. However, we still don't fully understand
how these interventions work and what makes them effective.

This meta-analysis by <a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/57577">Thompson et al.
(2024)</a> examines the specific behavior change techniques
(<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a>) that contribute to the effectiveness of
digital <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> interventions. By studying randomized
controlled trials (<a class="gls" href="#rct">RCTs</a>), it identifies which
techniques are most often associated with positive outcomes. It also assesses
whether interventions are based on theory, since theoretical foundations are
essential for developing effective behavioral interventions. These insights can
inform the development of more effective, evidence-based digital solutions for
individuals with eating disorders.

## What is the study about?

This meta-analysis examines which behavior change techniques are most effective
in digital interventions for eating disorders. The researchers wanted to
understand what specific components make these digital treatments work and how
they should be designed to help people overcome eating disorder symptoms. Their
analysis focused on identifying the active ingredients that contribute to
positive outcomes, whether interventions were based on sound psychological
theory, and how different delivery methods (websites, apps, etc.) might affect
treatment success.

The researchers systematically searched eight databases following
<a class="gls" href="#prisma">PRISMA</a> guidelines, focusing on interventions
that:

- Involved adults with eating disorder symptoms
- Used self-management or guided self-help digital interventions
- Measured outcomes with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire
- Used a randomized controlled design

Studies focused on children, relapse prevention, or those using outdated
technologies were excluded.

The researchers analyzed 17 randomized controlled trials representing 5,254
participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe (65%), with others from
Australia/New Zealand (24%) and North America (12%). The interventions were
primarily website-based (88%), with only 35% including mobile apps.

Each intervention was assessed using the behavior change technique Taxonomy,
which identifies specific techniques designed to change behavior. Two reviewers
independently coded the presence of each technique, with any disagreements
resolved through discussion. The modes of delivery (the different methods and
channels through which intervention content is delivered to users, such as
websites, mobile applications, text messaging, or emails) were also assessed.

The theoretical basis of interventions was evaluated to determine whether they
were clearly grounded in established theories like cognitive behavioral therapy
(<a class="gls" href="#cbt">CBT</a>). This assessment was important because
theory-based interventions are generally considered more effective.

The researchers analyzed which behavior change techniques were most common in
effective interventions and conducted a meta-analysis to determine overall
effectiveness compared to control groups.

## What does the study tell us?

This meta-analysis provides important insights into the effectiveness of digital
interventions for eating disorders and the behavior change techniques that
contribute to their success:

### Effectiveness of digital interventions

Digital interventions for eating disorders show moderate and statistically
significant effect sizes in favor of treatment compared to waitlist or
treatment-as-usual controls (MD=-0.57, 95% CI −0.80 to −0.39; p<0.001). Most
studies (94%) demonstrated effectiveness at post-intervention, with effects
maintained at follow-up.

### Behavior change techniques in effective interventions

The most frequently included <a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> in effective
interventions were:

- **Self-monitoring of behavior** (100% of effective interventions)
- **Problem solving** (94%)
- **Information about antecedents** (94%)
- **Feedback on behavior** (81%)
- **Self-monitoring of outcomes of behavior** (81%)
- **Action planning** (75%)

Effective interventions included an average of 14
<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> (range 9-18). No single
<a class="gls" href="#bct">BCT</a> emerged as a key moderator of effectiveness,
suggesting that a combination of techniques works best.

### Theoretical basis is important

Interventions with stronger theoretical grounding showed significantly better
outcomes than those with weaker theoretical foundations. Nearly all studies
(94%) referenced cognitive behavioral therapy or the transdiagnostic theory of
eating disorders as their basis.

### Modes of delivery

Most interventions relied heavily on websites (88%) and text-based content
delivery. Mobile apps were included in only 35% of studies. All interventions
included textual information, while multimedia features like video (18%) and
audio (29%) were less common. About half of the interventions (47%) included
some human interaction through text messages or email.

The number of delivery modes did not significantly moderate intervention
effectiveness, contrary to hypotheses that multimedia approaches would enhance
outcomes.

### Therapist involvement

Interventions ranged from self-guided to having minimal or some therapist
involvement. Interestingly, the level of therapist support did not significantly
moderate intervention effectiveness, suggesting that well-designed digital
interventions can be effective even with minimal human guidance.

## How do we assess this study?

This evaluation was done according to the <a class="gls" href="#magic">MAGIC Criteria</a>, using the following five questions:

### How substantial are the effects?

The study incorporates the results from 80 RCTs, with participants accurately depicting the ED demographics (predominantly women, different types of EDs).
16 out of 17 studies report some sort of theoretical basis in their intervention designs and 13 have a construct their respective treatment designs target. The way theory or predictors were used to select or develop BCTs is reported in 13 studies, but most of the time not explicitly so; the authors would simply list features and their theoretical constructs.

The results reveal statistically significant effects favoring digital interventions in order to alleviate EDs. The effect size MD of -0.57 (95% CI –0.80 to –0.39, Z=4.77, P < .001) shows that, on average, participants that were in the group with access to a digital intervention experiences notable improvements when compared to those in control groups.

High heterogeneity (I²=77%) warranted a subgroup analyses, but the resulting sensitivity analysis did not explain the variability. The only statistically relevant moderation effect coming from the subgroup analysis shows that interventions highly grounded in theory (MD=–0.86, 95% CI –1.06 to –0.66; I²=37%) are significantly more effective than those with low theoretical basis (MD=–0.36, 95% CI –0.61 to –0.11; I²=56%).

Follow-ups were conducted for 9 out of 17 studies and they reveal a somewhat lower effect size of MD = -33 (95% CI –0.49 to –0.18, Z=4.27, P<0.001), indicating that the effects diminish over time. Important to note is the finding that these effects are similar to those found in some traditional, face to face, treatments for mild to moderate EDs. 

The authors explicitly state that, even though the effect size is significant (meaning an effect is unlikely due to chance) the meta-analysis does not assess clinical meaningfulness (whether the change is large enough to be important in patients' daily lives). 




### How are the results presented?

The results are broken down across several domains:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Pooled outcomes using mean differences, confidence intervals, Z-scores, and heterogeneity (I²)</li>
      <li>Subgroup analyses based on the extent to which psychological theory is used within a study, and BCT types</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Behavior change techniques (BCTs):</strong> coding each intervention and highlighting the most common ones that appear in effective interventions </li>
  <li><strong>Modes of delivery:</strong> based on the use of digital channels (apps, web, multimedia) showing predominant reliance on text and websites</li>
  <li><strong>Risk of bias:</strong> using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tools</li>
  <li><strong>Follow-up data:</strong> looking into immediate and sustained treatment effects</li>
</ul>






### How generalizable are the findings?

Overall generalizibility is heavily influenced by the sample size and demographics:
<ul>
  <li>Total participants across included RCTs: 5,254</li>
  <li>Studies with ≥95% female participants: 53% (9/17)</li>
  <li>Studies that reported ethnicity: 18% (3/17)</li>
  <li>Mean age range across studies: 22.1 to 43.2 years</li>
  <li>Europe: 65% (11/17 studies)</li>
  <li>Australia/New Zealand: 24% (4/17 studies)</li>
  <li>North America: 12% (2/17 studies)</li>
</ul>

This breakdown suggests that the findings are robust within certain contexts, meaning that one should be cautious when generalizing a to more diverse population.
The field of research itself would benefit from a study with a broader demographic inclusion, in particular men and older adults that are severely underrepresented in ED research.

It must be noted that the meta-analysis uses sound methodological methods and corrects for bias wherever possible.



### What makes the meta analysis scientifically relevant?

The main thing that makes this meta analysis relevant is in the rigorous dissection of mechanism behind each intervention (type) used in the primary papers. The authors use robust statistical techniques, lay a lot of worth on theoretical foundations and include a systematic approach to BCT identification. The result is a theoretically sound and evidence-based approach to designing digital interventions for EDs important for application users, designers and medical experts/researchers alike.


### How methodologically reliable are the findings?

This meta-analysis is characterized by a strong adherence to best practices and transparency. It includes papers found across 8 major databases and includes studies that exclusively focus on RCTs. The inclusion criteria was comprehensive and strictly adhered to. All included studies are coded using BCT Taxonomy, modes of delivery were classified using Delivery Ontology v2, Theory Coding Scheme (TCS) is used to examine the theoretical foundation of each study and the coding was performed by two independent researchers with a third mediator to resolve discrepancies. Random-effects model accounts for heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses. 
High dropout rates (6.7% to 58%) and missing date raise the chances of attrition bias occurring, but subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in overall outcomes.
Authors themselves note the possibility of self-reporting bias occurring, as well as that one of the measurement tools, EDE-Q, may not have covered all compensatory behaviours.

Overall, the methodological reliability can be described as solid, with possible bias coming from primary studies themselves and not the methodology. The authors acknowledge the limitations, make note of mentioning that the results should be interpreted with caution and call for higher-quality research in the future.


## Practical Implications

The meta-analysis confirms clinical effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing core ED symptoms, thus supporting broader implementation of these kinds of mental healthcare models, especially for populations unable or unwilling to access traditional therapy models. It also underscores the importance of theory-based design, as well as BCT as foundations for effective interventions. Grounding digital tools in established psychological frameworks and practices is important for all stakeholders: first of all the patients whose mental health could potentially be compromised, as well as researchers who otherwise could not do further research in this domain and intervention designers and developers responsible. 

Another important implication comes from the demographic diversity, or the lack thereof, highlighting the need to exercise caution when generalizing the findings to broader population.

Overall, this meta-analysis provides practical, evidence-based guidelines for improving digital interventions and bridging the treatment gap.






## Illustrative Study Examples

The following study examples illustrate how behavior change techniques were
implemented in digital interventions for eating disorders and their outcomes.

### Study Example 1: Fitzsimmons-Craft et al. (2020)

A notable study by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15633">Fitzsimmons-Craft
et al. (2020)</a> evaluated "Student Bodies–Eating Disorders"
(<a class="gls" href="#sbed">SB-ED</a>), a digital cognitive behavioral therapy
(<a class="gls" href="#cbt">CBT</a>) intervention for college women with eating
disorders. This cluster randomized trial compared the digital intervention to
directing students to standard campus treatment resources across 27 U.S.
universities.

The intervention targeted college women because of the elevated prevalence of
eating disorders on campuses (13.5% of US college women affected) and the fact
that 95% of first-time cases occur by age 25. Most concerning was that fewer
than 20% of students with eating disorders reported receiving treatment,
highlighting significant care delivery gaps.

SB-ED incorporated several key components of cognitive behavioral therapy for
eating disorders:

- Reducing <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> behaviors through self-monitoring
  and regular eating
- Improving body image
- Regulating emotions
- Addressing shape checking and avoidance behaviors
- Challenging negative thoughts
- Preventing relapse

The program included psychoeducational content, meal planning and tracking
tools, self-monitoring logs, and other interactive features including a
messaging platform for coach-user communication.

The results showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder
psychopathology in the intervention group compared to the control group at both
post-intervention and long-term follow-up. The controlled effect size (d = 0.40)
was comparable to meta-analytic findings on the effect of in-person CBT for
eating disorders. By the 2-year follow-up, half of the intervention group no
longer met clinical criteria for an eating disorder.

Particularly notable was the improvement in treatment access: 83% of students
offered the intervention began it, but only 28% of students in the control group
reported seeking treatment for their eating disorder at any point during the
2-year follow-up. This shows the significant potential of digital interventions
to bridge the treatment gap for eating disorders.

The study exemplifies how a theoretically-grounded digital intervention
incorporating multiple behavior change techniques can effectively reduce eating
disorder symptoms and improve treatment access in a population that
traditionally faces significant barriers to care.

### Study Example 2: Effectiveness of an online self-help program, expert-patient support, and their combination for eating disorders: Results from a randomized controlled trial (2022)

In a randomized controlled trial, Rohrbach et al. (2022) evaluate the effectiveness of a digital intervention, support provided by recovered patients and the combination of the two.

**Methodology:**
A total of 355 participants, 96.7% female with the mean age of 28 and many never having received ED treatment, were randomized into four groups:
- digital intervention only
- expert-patient support only
- both digital intervention and expert-patient support
- waitlist control

The RCT lasted for 12 months, with 8 weeks of intervention time and 6 online assessments.

Featback- the digital intervention the researchers used- is an automated online self-help web-app. It delivered weekly e-mail feedback based on symptom tracking and included psychoeducation.

Expert-patient support included weekly chatting sessions.

Participants in the third group additionally had free access to traditional therapy modes, in order to make it comparable the waiting list conditions.

**Results:**

All three intervention types led to significant symptom reduction when compared to the waitlist (Cohen's d=0.38). ED symptom reduction was measured using EDE-Q. When compared to each other, no significant differences were found, but the improvements held for the 12 month RCT period.
Notably, patients in the third group, combined approach, did not show better treatment effects, but they did report higher user satisfaction.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Intervention</th>
      <th>Mean User Satisfaction</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Featback</td>
      <td>5.8/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Patient-expert</td>
      <td>7.4/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Combination</td>
      <td>7.1/10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

However, only 38% in the combination condition received "enough" of both components.

Modest improvements in anxiety and depression at post-intervention, as well as the gains in self-efficacy were observed in the 12 month follow up period. 
There was no significant difference across groups when it comes to seeking professional help.

**Discussion:**

This study confirms that low-threshold digital interventions like Featback can effectively reduce ED symptoms, even for individuals not currently in treatment.
The absence of additive benefits from combining guidance with automation raises important questions about the cost-effectiveness of guided support. However, seeing that the results show that users value human connection, even if it doesn’t directly influence clinical outcomes, an argument could be made that it adds net positive value to clinical outcomes by proxy (user satisfaction boosts engagement)
