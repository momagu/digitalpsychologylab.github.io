  "Behavior Change Techniques in Digital Interventions for Eating Disorders:
  Findings from a Meta-Analysis"
---

Digital interventions offer significant promise in addressing the treatment gap
for eating disorders, with specific behavior change techniques showing
consistent effectiveness across multiple studies. Understanding which techniques
work best is crucial for developing evidence-based digital solutions that can
reach those currently unable to access traditional care.

## Meta-Analysis Overview

**Focus of study**: Identification and analysis of behavior change techniques
(<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a>) in digital interventions for eating
disorders, examining which techniques are most frequently associated with
effective interventions

**Target Group**: Adults with mild to moderate eating disorders, primarily
females (>90% in most studies) aged 17-55 years

**Effect Sizes**: Moderate and statistically significant improvement in eating
disorder symptoms for digital interventions compared to waitlist or
treatment-as-usual controls (MD=-0.57, 95% CI −0.080 to −0.39; p<0.001)

**Additional Findings**: Interventions with stronger theoretical grounding
showed significantly better outcomes; the most common effective
<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> (defined as those present in at least 75%
of effective interventions) included self-monitoring of behavior,
problem-solving, information about antecedents, feedback on behavior, and
self-monitoring of outcomes

## Introduction

Eating disorders (<a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a>) have the highest death
rate among psychiatric disorders and can cause lasting physical, emotional, and
neurobiological damage when untreated. The current treatment model fails to meet
patient needs, with most individuals with <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a> not
receiving proper care due to limited access to specialized services, long
waiting times, and the shame associated with these conditions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made these challenges worse, causing more urgent
referrals and longer waiting times in an already under-resourced system. There
is an urgent need to develop alternative treatment approaches that can support
traditional care pathways and address this critical service gap.

Digital interventions—including websites, mobile applications, and other
technology-based platforms—can improve access to evidence-based treatments.
These interventions have several advantages: they can reach many individuals at
minimal cost, can be accessed anonymously when convenient for the user, and
allow for self-paced engagement. The anonymity of digital interventions may be
especially helpful for individuals with <a class="gls" href="#eds">EDs</a> who
often face shame as a barrier to seeking traditional treatment.

Digital self-management interventions can expand the reach of evidence-based
treatments and help more individuals receive support for their condition.
Research shows promising evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions
in treating <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> symptoms, with results often
maintained or improved at follow-up. However, we still don't fully understand
how these interventions work and what makes them effective.

This meta-analysis by <a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/57577">Thompson et al.
(2024)</a> examines the specific behavior change techniques
(<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a>) that contribute to the effectiveness of
digital <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> interventions. By studying randomized
controlled trials (<a class="gls" href="#rct">RCTs</a>), it identifies which
techniques are most often associated with positive outcomes. It also assesses
whether interventions are based on theory, since theoretical foundations are
essential for developing effective behavioral interventions. These insights can
inform the development of more effective, evidence-based digital solutions for
individuals with eating disorders.

## What is the study about?

This meta-analysis examines which behavior change techniques are most effective
in digital interventions for eating disorders. The researchers wanted to
understand what specific components make these digital treatments work and how
they should be designed to help people overcome eating disorder symptoms. Their
analysis focused on identifying the active ingredients that contribute to
positive outcomes, whether interventions were based on sound psychological
theory, and how different delivery methods (websites, apps, etc.) might affect
treatment success.

The researchers systematically searched eight databases following
<a class="gls" href="#prisma">PRISMA</a> guidelines, focusing on interventions
that:

- Involved adults with eating disorder symptoms
- Used self-management or guided self-help digital interventions
- Measured outcomes with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire
- Used a randomized controlled design

Studies focused on children, relapse prevention, or those using outdated
technologies were excluded.

The researchers analyzed 17 randomized controlled trials representing 5,254
participants. Most studies were conducted in Europe (65%), with others from
Australia/New Zealand (24%) and North America (12%). The interventions were
primarily website-based (88%), with only 35% including mobile apps.

Each intervention was assessed using the behavior change technique Taxonomy,
which identifies specific techniques designed to change behavior. Two reviewers
independently coded the presence of each technique, with any disagreements
resolved through discussion. The modes of delivery (the different methods and
channels through which intervention content is delivered to users, such as
websites, mobile applications, text messaging, or emails) were also assessed.

The theoretical basis of interventions was evaluated to determine whether they
were clearly grounded in established theories like cognitive behavioral therapy
(<a class="gls" href="#cbt">CBT</a>). This assessment was important because
theory-based interventions are generally considered more effective.

The researchers analyzed which behavior change techniques were most common in
effective interventions and conducted a meta-analysis to determine overall
effectiveness compared to control groups.

## What does the study tell us?

This meta-analysis provides important insights into the effectiveness of digital
interventions for eating disorders and the behavior change techniques that
contribute to their success:

### Effectiveness of digital interventions

Digital interventions for eating disorders show moderate and statistically
significant effect sizes in favor of treatment compared to waitlist or
treatment-as-usual controls (MD=-0.57, 95% CI −0.80 to −0.39; p<0.001). Most
studies (94%) demonstrated effectiveness at post-intervention, with effects
maintained at follow-up.

### Behavior change techniques in effective interventions

The most frequently included <a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> in effective
interventions were:

- **Self-monitoring of behavior** (100% of effective interventions)
- **Problem solving** (94%)
- **Information about antecedents** (94%)
- **Feedback on behavior** (81%)
- **Self-monitoring of outcomes of behavior** (81%)
- **Action planning** (75%)

Effective interventions included an average of 14
<a class="gls" href="#bcts">BCTs</a> (range 9-18). No single
<a class="gls" href="#bct">BCT</a> emerged as a key moderator of effectiveness,
suggesting that a combination of techniques works best.

### Theoretical basis is important

Interventions with stronger theoretical grounding showed significantly better
outcomes than those with weaker theoretical foundations. Nearly all studies
(94%) referenced cognitive behavioral therapy or the transdiagnostic theory of
eating disorders as their basis.

### Modes of delivery

Most interventions relied heavily on websites (88%) and text-based content
delivery. Mobile apps were included in only 35% of studies. All interventions
included textual information, while multimedia features like video (18%) and
audio (29%) were less common. About half of the interventions (47%) included
some human interaction through text messages or email.

The number of delivery modes did not significantly moderate intervention
effectiveness, contrary to hypotheses that multimedia approaches would enhance
outcomes.

### Therapist involvement

Interventions ranged from self-guided to having minimal or some therapist
involvement. Interestingly, the level of therapist support did not significantly
moderate intervention effectiveness, suggesting that well-designed digital
interventions can be effective even with minimal human guidance.

## Illustrative Study Examples

The following study examples illustrate how behavior change techniques were
implemented in digital interventions for eating disorders and their outcomes.

### Study Example 1: Fitzsimmons-Craft et al. (2020)

A notable study by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15633">Fitzsimmons-Craft
et al. (2020)</a> evaluated "Student Bodies–Eating Disorders"
(<a class="gls" href="#sbed">SB-ED</a>), a digital cognitive behavioral therapy
(<a class="gls" href="#cbt">CBT</a>) intervention for college women with eating
disorders. This cluster randomized trial compared the digital intervention to
directing students to standard campus treatment resources across 27 U.S.
universities.

The intervention targeted college women because of the elevated prevalence of
eating disorders on campuses (13.5% of US college women affected) and the fact
that 95% of first-time cases occur by age 25. Most concerning was that fewer
than 20% of students with eating disorders reported receiving treatment,
highlighting significant care delivery gaps.

SB-ED incorporated several key components of cognitive behavioral therapy for
eating disorders:

- Reducing <a class="gls" href="#eds">ED</a> behaviors through self-monitoring
  and regular eating
- Improving body image
- Regulating emotions
- Addressing shape checking and avoidance behaviors
- Challenging negative thoughts
- Preventing relapse

The program included psychoeducational content, meal planning and tracking
tools, self-monitoring logs, and other interactive features including a
messaging platform for coach-user communication.

The results showed significantly greater reductions in eating disorder
psychopathology in the intervention group compared to the control group at both
post-intervention and long-term follow-up. The controlled effect size (d = 0.40)
was comparable to meta-analytic findings on the effect of in-person CBT for
eating disorders. By the 2-year follow-up, half of the intervention group no
longer met clinical criteria for an eating disorder.

Particularly notable was the improvement in treatment access: 83% of students
offered the intervention began it, but only 28% of students in the control group
reported seeking treatment for their eating disorder at any point during the
2-year follow-up. This shows the significant potential of digital interventions
to bridge the treatment gap for eating disorders.

The study exemplifies how a theoretically-grounded digital intervention
incorporating multiple behavior change techniques can effectively reduce eating
disorder symptoms and improve treatment access in a population that
traditionally faces significant barriers to care.
